This app is a Tasker plugin to trigger a vibration pattern on the wearable device only, for a discreet notification tap where a popup is not required.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  

To use it create a new Tasker task and add TTW from the plugins. You'll be able to change the type of vibration tap within the configuration screen.
