            </header>
            <section id="main_content">
                <p>This privacy policy governs your use of any software (Application) for mobile devices that were created by CodeChimp.</p>           
                
                <h3>Personal Data</h3>
                <p>Where personal information (data entered, contacts, list of applications etc.) is used it is never used by CodeChimp or distributed to any third party, unless required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.</p>
                <p>Where user data is stored on cloud/application servers we will retain user provided data for as long as you use the application and for a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
     
                <h3>Registration</h3>
                <p>Where an application requires registration of an email address/login we may use this information you provided us to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.<br>
                You will be able to unsubscribe any marketing communication.</p>

                <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
                <p>Some applications collect analytical data.  This is anonymous and does not contain any personally entered data.  It is used to analyse frequency of use, what features are used, navigation patterns etc.  This data is used to improve the application.</p>                
                
                <h3>Advertising</h3>
                <p>Where applications display advertising we work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the application. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Application, including, but not limited to, the unique identification ID of your mobile device and your mobile telephone number. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can’t identify you personally. These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you’ve downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non- precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the application and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>You can stop all collection of information by the application easily by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

                <h3>Children</h3>
                <p>We do not use the application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:apps@codechimp.org">android@codechimp.org</a>. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. Please be aware that, although we endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
                

                <h3>Contact us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:apps@codechimp.org">apps@codechimp.org</a></p>
